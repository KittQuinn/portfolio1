       <h2>Hello!</h2> 
       <p>My name is Sean, however I typically go by "Kitt" online.</p> 
       <p>I live in Texas, and have spent most of my life here, between Austin and the DFW metroplex.</p>
       <p>I'm currently learning web development, so that I may  turn my passion for interacting with people online into a profitable career.</p>

       <h3>Some of my interests include:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Gaming (on or offline. whether it's board games or computer games, I like them all)</li>
          <li>Music (every genre. literally, including obscure things like college drum cadences, throat chanting, even tesla coil music.)</li>
          <li>Fire-spinning (the artform itself is known as poi, I just happen to do it with fire)</li>
        </ul>
          </section>

      <h2>About Myself</h2>
        
        <p>My first experiences with the online world occurred at a very early age. As a child, my parents ran a BBS (Bulletin Board System) called "The Neutral Zone". I'd watch our computer in the living room as people connected to it via modem, and log in to play games like "Tradewarz" or "Legend of the Red Dragon". I was fascinated by the idea that people could connect with one another regardless of distance, and that fascination has grown from simple fascination to an ever-increasing desire to collaborate with like-minded folks, to make the online landscape full of places and things for everyone to enjoy.</p>
        <p>Outside of the internet, my number one passion is music. I am literally always listening to something, whether it's an actual song, or a tune I just cant get out of my head. It's also the number one subject I can discuss with anyone at great length without ever getting bored.</p>

        <p>Some site-services I hope to provide people with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Webdesign</li>
            <li>Page performance optimization</li>
            <li>Security optimizations, evaluations, and optimizations</li>
            
        </ul>
